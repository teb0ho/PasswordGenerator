# PasswordGenerator
A program that generates hard to guess passwords

Generated passwords will be saved in text file named "output.txt" in the res directory

To execute this program run the following commands from the root directory.

```
javac -d bin src/PasswordGen.java

java -cp bin PasswordGen

```
Or you can just run the compiled code as there is a class that is already compiled. By running the following command in the root directory.
```
java -cp bin PasswordGen
```

If the ```javac ``` command does not work on your CLI you might need set environment variables for your JDK.
